# Sunk cost fallac

The sunk cost fallacy is a [cognitive bias](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Cognitive+Biases) where we take into account what we've already lost or spent (in time, money, or effort) when making a decision about whether or not to maintain the present course of action in the future. The fallacy is thinking that past effort should have any bearing on the decision of whether or not to continue.
