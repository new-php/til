### What if They Just Don't Get It?

* The person might want to agree, but emotions won't let them. Help them back out without losing face.
* Don't assume they don't understand your reasoning; explaining again in the same way often doesn't help.
* Empathy is the key. What is your listener's perspective? What's important to him or her?
* Acknowledge your differences in perspectives.
* Phrase your argument using your the other person's terminology, objectives, and world view.
* Maybe you're not yelling loudly enough. (Kidding!)
* Take a time out. Switch the venue or medium.
* Involve an impartial, respected person as a mediator.
* Watch out for jargon. If it obfuscates the issue, look for a way to get it rephrased.
* Track interaction approaches that work with the person; stick to the method that succeeded earlier.
* Maybe you're wrong. It happens to the best of us.

### Persuading a More Technical Person

* Research technical aspects of the issue beforehand. What objections or new data may arise?
* Get solid data to support your argument. Be ready to drill into details.
* Remember that people often decide based on emotions, even when presented with data.
* Practice in front of a friendly more technical person.

### Persuading a Less Technical Person

* Don't make the other party feel dumb due to the lack of technical insight. Sounding superior backfires.
* State your conclusion first, before discussing the details of how you arrived at it.
* Research non-technical aspects of the issue beforehand. What objections or new data may arise?
* Practice in front of a friendly less technical person.

### Tips for Better Email Messages

* If you haven't persuaded after several back and forth emails, pick up the phone, or speak in-person.
* If your message is longer than 2 paragraphs, shorten it or use another medium.
* If your email is being ignored, send a follow-up. Don't take it personally—people get too much email.
* Note time of day/day of the week when the recipient responds most often. Send your message then.
* Lead with the strongest statement to grab attention.
* Assume only your first 2 sentences will be read.
* Use the Subject line to get your main point across.
* Use email to prepare the person for an in-person meeting or a phone conversation.
* Don't respond in the heat of the moment. Let your emotions cool off before hitting the Send button.
* Don't forget about non-email mediums: phone, postal mail, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, billboard, tattoo, etc.

### In-Person Conversations

* Dress appropriately for the venue, topic, expectations, and social norms.
* Consider where to speak: your workplace, his or her workplace, water cooler, lunchroom, etc.
* Find the best timing: some are grumpy in the mornings, sleepy after lunch, in a hurry at 5pm, etc.
* Come prepared. Impromptu talks on important topics have been known to lead to trouble.
* Harness the power of sharing a tasty treat.
* When in doubt, use a breath freshener.
* If you or the other party are in a foul mood, consider putting the conversation on hold and resuming later.
* Mimic the other party's general posture and gestures, but not exactly movement for movement.
* Be mindful of cultural differences in gestures and the distance between speaking parties.
* Smile. Breathe. Don't avoid eye contact.
* Practice a strong handshake. No limp wrist!
* Conclude by agreeing on the next steps and timeline.
* If sending a thank-you note, send it ASAP.

### Presenting to Managers and Executives

* Be brief. (E.g., consider "the [elevator pitch](https://isc.sans.org/diary/Elevator+pitch+for+explaining+security+risks+to+executives/4528).")
* Make your message business-relevant.
* If showing slides, use fewer bullet points. Consider skipping the slides altogether.
* In preparation, ask yourself and answer, "So what?" for the facts and conclusions you will discuss.
* Find an "executive sponsor" who will offer feedback in before and support you during the presentation.
* Use the tools, terminology, and conventions that your audience employs (e.g., the [SWOT matrix](https://isc.sans.org/diary/SWOT+matrix+for+describing+security+posture/4939)).

### At a Social Networking Reception

* Come early—fewer people and attendees are fresh.
* Don't stay by your friends' side. Meet new people.
* It's OK to come up to groups of strangers and join a conversation. Receptions are public conversations.
* Welcome newcomers into your conversations.
* Prepare chit-chat topics by reading news, books, etc.
* Hold an appropriate prop (e.g., wine glass) in one hand, but have one hand free to shake hands.
* Use people's names when speaking with them.
* Be enthusiastic. Try to look friendly, approachable.

### Improving Communication Skills

* Improvisational or stand-up comedy classes help.
* Consider joining a local Toastmasters club.
* Attend writing workshops (creative, resume, etc.).
* Practice on friends and in low-risk environments.
