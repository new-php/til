[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS-IS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS-IS)

Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS, also written ISIS) is a [routing protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing\_protocol) designed to move information efficiently within a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\_network), a group of physically connected computers or similar devices. It accomplishes this by determining the best [route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing) for data through a packet switching network.

The IS-IS protocol is defined in ISO/IEC 10589:2002[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS-IS#cite\_note-iso-store-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS-IS#cite\_note-iso-free-pdf-3) as an international standard within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference design. The [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_Engineering\_Task\_Force) (IETF) republished IS-IS in [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC\_\(identifier\)) [1142](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1142), but that RFC was later marked as _historic_ by [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC\_\(identifier\)) [7142](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7142) because it republished a draft rather than a final version of the (International Organization for Standardization) ISO standard, causing confusion.

IS-IS has been called "the [_de facto_ standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_facto\_standard) for large service provider [network backbones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbone\_network)."[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS-IS#cite\_note-4)
